The <font color="#ff0000">built </font>element comprises all elements that are primarily part of the construction of a built facility, i.e., its structural and space separating system. <font color="#ff0000">Built </font>elements are all physically existent and tangible things  
> NOTE Definition from ISO 6707-1:  Major functional part of a building, examples are foundation, floor, roof, wall.  
This _Ifc<font color="#ff0000">Built</font>Element_ is a generalization of all elements that participate in a building system. Typical examples of __Ifc<font color="#ff0000">Built</font>Element__'s are (among others):  
* <font color="#ff0000">built </font>elements within a space separation systems
* <font color="#ff0000">built </font>elements within an enclosure system (such as a facade)
* <font color="#ff0000">built </font>elements within a fenestration system
* <font color="#ff0000">built </font>elements within a load bearing system
* <font color="#ff0000">built </font>elements within a foundation system

  
> EXAMPLE <font color="#ff0000">built </font>elements are walls, curtain wall, doors, columns, pile, and others.
