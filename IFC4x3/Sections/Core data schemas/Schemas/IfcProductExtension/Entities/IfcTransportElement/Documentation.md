A transport element is a generalization of all transport related objects that move people, animals or goods within a <font color="#ff0000">REMOVE {</font>building or building complex<font color="#ff0000">} Facility</font>. The _IfcTransportElement_ defines the occurrence of a transport element, that (if given), is expressed by the _IfcTransportElementType_.  
> EXAMPLE Transportation elements include elevator (lift), escalator, moving walkway, etc.  
> NOTE&nbsp; More detailed equipment that may be a part of a transportation device, like a lifting hook, is defined as _IfcDiscreteAccessory_. It maybe included as a part of the _IfcTransportElement_ by virtue of the objectified relationship _IfcRelAggregates_.  
<font color="#ff0000">Transport element can describe fixed or non fixed elements, which can either be identified as specified operational assets within a facility or vehicles that interact with the facility as a user or customer.</font>  
<font color="#ff0000">In the case of operational assets, instances of </font>_IfcTransportElement_<font color="#ff0000">s can represent individual identifiable vehicles or structures with properties such as serial numbers, registration numbers etc. and be typed accordingly by instances of </font>_IfcTransportElementType_<font color="#ff0000">.</font>  
<font color="#ff0000">In the case transport elements that interact as users or customers, such as cars on a road or vessels at a port, </font>_IfcTransportElementType_<font color="#ff0000"> is used to define element specifications which are used to design, analyse and provide operational constraints to the facility.</font>  
Depending on local classification systems transport elements and transportation systems in buildings are either considered as part of a <font color="#ff0000">built </font>system, or as part of a <font color="#ff0000">built </font>service system. Within IFC they are considered as part of a <font color="#ff0000">built </font>system and may have to be mapped appropriately.
