Is a planar curve of spiral type. The curvature of this curve varies in a quadratical relationship with the arc length. Consequently, due to the linear rise and drop of curvature and the parametrisation of the curve (from -∞ to ∞) curvature has to be defined in two quadratic equations that meet in the middle of the spiral. The quadratic constant for both sides is equal (with a different sign). The linear term applies only to the part with the opposite sign.

The curvature of the curve is calculated as.

start to middle of the spiral
K = K0 s²/QuadraticTerm² + s/LinearTerm
middle to end of spiral
K = K0 (-1 + s/LinearTerm - s²/QuadraticTerm)
where
K ... curvature
K0 ... start curvature
